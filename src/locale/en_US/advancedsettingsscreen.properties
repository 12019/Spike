suspension_instructions=<p align="justify">In order for Spike to avoid loosing readings from your transmitter and perform download/upload operations in the background when you activate glucose sharing to online services (ex: Nightscout or Dexcom Share) it avoids being completely suspended by iOS to ensure stability.</p><p></p><p align="justify">In a normal scenario you should let Spike manage suspension but advanced users might want to change the above settings. The less aggressive Spike avoids suspension, the better for battery life.</p><p></p><p align="justify">If you want to try and save battery life you should select "Standard" or "Moderate" if your transmitter is a Dexcom G5 or G4, "Aggressive" or "Very Aggressive" for all other transmitters.</p><p></p><p align="justify">If Spike is freezing or you are having missed readings, start by using the "Very Aggressive" mode and see if it fixes the issue. If it does, try the "Aggressive" mode and then the "Moderate" and finally the "Standard" until you can find a mode that works for you and saves the maximum amount of battery consumption.</p>
