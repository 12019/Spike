insulin_settings_explanation=DIA (Duration of Insulin Action)\: The amount of hours the insulin stays active in your body. This setting is used to calculate IOB (Insulin On Board) on Spike's main chart. If you don't know your DIA, press the "Guide" button below to learn how to determine it.\n\nDefault\: The insulin that Spike will use when adding treatments from the Today Widget, watches or any other app that connects to the Spike's internal Nightscout server.
