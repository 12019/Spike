insulin_settings_explanation=DIA (Duration of Insulin Action)\: The amount of hours the insulin stays active in your body. This setting is used to calculate IOB (Insulin On Board) on Spike's main chart. If you don't know your DIA, press the "Guide" button below to learn how to determine it.\n\nDefault\: The insulin that Spike will use when adding treatments from the Today Widget, watches or any other app that connects to the Spike's internal Nightscout server. If you don't select a default insulin, Spike will use the first one on your list.

carb_absorption_rate_description=The rate at which carbs are absorbed into the bloodstream (in the absence of any prebolus or IOB) measured in grams per hour. If you don't know your absorption rate, leave it at 30g, it's suitable for most people. If you want to determine your absorption rate follow the instructions given by the OpenAPS team by clicking the button below.

carb_absorption_time_description_label=The time it takes for carbs to enter the bloodstream. This value will influence the COB algorithm. The dafault carb type is the one that will be used when no carb type is selected when entering a treatment or when Spike imports treatments from Nightscout.

insulin_sensitivity_factor_guide_label=ISF Guide
isf_ic_trend_bgtarget_description_label=ISF (Insulin Sensitivity Factor)\: How much one unit of insulin lowers your blood glucose. For example, if your Insulin Sensitivity Factor is 50, one unit of insulin lowers your blood glucose by 50 mg/dL. Spike also supports Insulin Sensitivity Factor in mmol/L. If Spike is set to mmol/L, an Insulin Sensitivity Factor of 2.5 means that one unit of insulin lowers your blood glucose by 2.5 mmol/L.\n\nI\:C (Insulin-to-Carbohydrate Ratio)\: Number of grams of carbohydrate covered by one unit of insulin. For example, if your Insulin-to-Carbohydrate Ratio is 15, then you need to deliver one unit of insulin to cover every fifteen grams of carbohydrate you eat.\n\nTo determine your ISF and I\:C please read the guides below.\n\nTarget BG\: The blood glucose level (mg/dL or mmol/L) you're aiming at, the one you want to stay at most of the time.\n\nTrends\: The amount of insulin or carbs needed to make an upward or downward trend arrow flat. Upward trend arrows need insulin and downward trend arrows need carbohydrates.
