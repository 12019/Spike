1.0.5
Minor changes to the watch settings screen to try to mitigate a bug that happens sporadically and doesn't allow users to select a calendar. Might still need more fixes.
Fixed iPhone X black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Thank you to Josh Flynt for helping me test this in his iPhone X.

1.0.4
Added more debug messages to Nightscout and Dexcom connectors to provide better support in case someone has problems with any of these services.
The Today Widget was not coloring the main glucose label correctly while in mmol/L and the chart was not displaying values as it should (also while in mmol/L). Both issues have been fixed.
Removed support for dynamic coloring of the line in the Today Widget (to reflect high, in range and low values) while in mmol/L. It doesn't work well because the coloring ranges in the line need to be whole numbers, doesn't work with decimals. So, for mmol/L, the line is now always a solid color. To make up for mmol/L users, they now have a setting inside Spike to customize the line color. Mg/dL users continue to have a dynamic line that changes color if the glucose values are high, in range or low.
Fixed a bug that prevent alarms from being properly snoozed.
Added an option for "Entire Day" when creating/editing alarms.

1.0.2
Fixed a bug in the Apple Watch settings screen.
Improved layout of "Add Alarm" popup on larger screens.
Improved Offline Loop feature.
