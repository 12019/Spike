1.1.1
FEATURE: Pre-snooze or unsnooze alarms. Going to a meeting, the movies, a social event? Don't want Spike to bother you with alarms? You can now pre-snooze your alarms by going to the three dots menu on the upper right corner of the home screen and clicking the Snoozer button. Left the event earlier than expected? You can unsnooze the alarm by clicking the same button. A lot of code was ported from iOSxDripReader and adapted to Spike so a big thanks to Johan Degraeve for this!  
FEATURE: Spike to Spike follower mode, no nightscout required. As long as the master's Spike is on the same network than the follower's Spike, you can follow the master connecting directly to it. Go to settings -> integration, internal HTTP server and follow the on-screen instruction.
FEATURE: Full offline Pebble watch support! You can now connect your Pebble watch directly to Spike and have updated glucose values completely offline. Go to settings -> integration -> internal HTTP server and follow the on-screen instructions.
FEATURE: Full offline Garmin watch support! You can now connect your Garmin watch directly to Spike and have updated glucose values completely offline. Go to settings -> integration -> internal HTTP server and follow the on-screen instructions.
FEATURE: Full offline Nightguard support (and many other Nightscout apps)! By using the Nightguard app you can have a scrollable chart on your Apple Watch without an Internet connection or Nightscout site. Go to settings -> integration -> internal HTTP server and follow the on-screen instructions.
FIX: When in follower mode, Spike will now correctly show glucose values in full screen.
FIX: When in follower mode, Spike will now only consider glucose values fetched from Nightscout. Calibrations and any other treatment will not be fetched. This was causing false "LOW" values in the follower's chart when the master inserted calibrations and also triggering low glucose alarms.
FIX: Slope arrow should now display correctly in follower mode!
FIX: The authorize calendar access button in settings -> watch was not showing. Sorry about that!
FIX: Notification ID for Transmitter PL when a dead or expired sensor is detected is now fixed. (Johan Degraeve)
FIX: Attempt to fix a small bug that sometimes can show the chart in the future.
FIX: 3DTouch menu shortcuts were not working correctly. All is fixed in this update.
FIX: Snoozing a calibration from the Calibration Popup or lockescreen notification now works as expected.
FIX: First time an alarm fires, it now respects the mute status. (Johan Degraeve)
FIX: Several general fixes and code improvements to keep Spike more stable.
ENHANCEMENT: Some master apps send values to nightscout with a bigger delay than expected. If that happens, Spike follower will retry fetching the next batch of data in 30 seconds to avoid outdated data being shown in the chart and today widget. This should also fix an issue where Spike follower was not updating values after large gaps of data in the master's Nightscout site.
ENHANCEMENT: When in follower mode, the user can now switch nightscout sites on demand without needing to restart Spike.
ENHANCEMENT: User can now select a time offset (in minutes) when in Follower mode. If you're seeing glucose values always in the past or in the future due to being in different time zones, you can go to settings -> general -> collection mode and set a time offset to apply to all glucose values in the chart.
ENHANCEMENT: Don't fire the inactive alert if user hasn't started a sensor and inserted the initial 2 calibrations. 
ENHANCEMENT: Don't try to avoid suspension if Spike is in the foreground. This should save some of battery.
ENHANCEMENT: Initial calibrations popup now stays active for 4 minutes instead of the previous 2 minutes.
ENHANCEMENT: Improved handling of initial calibration popup when invoked from the lock screen notification.

1.1.0
FEATURE: Nightscout follower mode! Now you can use Spike as master or as follower. To activate follower mode go to settings -> general -> data collection, switch to follower and input the Nightscout URL you want to follow. Done! Followers will have all Spike features like Apple Watch complication, Today Widget, Alarms, 24H Glucose Distribution, Offline Looping, etc. You can switch back and forth from master to follower mode and vice versa. A follower can even act as a proxy by getting data from a Nightscout URL and sharing it to another Nightscout URL or Dexcom Share. (Follower mode for Dexcom Share is coming soon!)
FEATURE: Lock screen glucose notifications now with intervals. Set your desired interval in settings -> share. Default value is 3 (every 15 minutes).
FEATURE: See number of calibrations and time of last calibration in the Sensor Screen. User can also delete last calibration or all calibrations (use wisely!).
FEATURE: User can now select colors for the pie chart independently from the main chart. All current users that have custom colors for the pie chart, after upgrading to this release, will have the pie chart colors reset to defaults. Go to settings -> chart to change the colors to your liking.
FEATURE: Alert of malfunctioning or expired sensors when using Transmiter PL. (Code ported from iOSxDripReader)
ENHANCEMENT: New gap fix for the Apple Watch complication. If you experience gaps in your Apple Watch between readings, be sure to go to settings -> watch and apply the "Gap Fix" option. When this option is enabled, Spike will always create a 10 minute calendar event with your latest glucose value. This seems to fix the issue. As soon as a new reading comes from your transmitter, Spike will edit the previous calendar event and set it to 5 minutes before adding the new 10 minute calendar event. This will avoid event overlaps. (Thank you to Kamil Armacki for beta testing the fix)
ENHANCEMENT: The transmitter screen will now auto-refresh every 5 seconds when scanning for a device. This should avoid having to close and open the screen to check if the device is connected to Spike.
ENHANCEMENT: Today widget line colouring transitions are now much more accurate. This only applies to mg/dL users. I want to give a special thanks to Farshid Ghods, the developer that made the original colouring code for the PNChart library, for putting up with me. We spent weeks emailing each other back and forth and testing the changes until we got it right. Thank you for your patience, Farshid!
ENHANCEMENT: Popup that shows a warning when another app is trying to connect to the same transmitter will only show a maximum of 5 times in case of false positives. (Johan Degraeve)
ENHANCEMENT: New alternative method for suspension prevention. If you're one of the 3-4 users that reported missed readings due to iOS suspending Spike, please go to settings -> advanced and try the alternative method. Be sure to read the instructions.
ENHANCEMENT: Alarm Snoozer popup now displays current glucose value.
FIX: No more double popups on initial calibrations (after starting a new sensor). No more having to, sometimes, enter a third calibration for Spike to start showing glucose values in the chart.
FIX: App badge does not disappear anymore when an alarm or any other notification is fired. 
FIX: Several other small overall fixes and improvements.
NOTE: There seems to still be an issue that sometimes (rarely) the app may freeze and close. This is a very hard to track bug because it happens rarely and sporadically. As soon as I'm able to track the root cause of this, it will be fixed and will push a new update to TestFlight.

1.0.9
ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of check mute status. It will check mute only if phone mute alert is on. Code will consume less CPU cycles as well and user should not have interruptions every 5 minutes when listening to audio if the mute switch is off in Spike's alarm settings (Johan Degraeve)
ENHANCEMENT: Lock screen notifications that show the glucose value every 5 minutes are now turned off by default for new Spike users. (Ability to set time intervals for these notifications is coming soon)
ENHANCEMENT: User can now set lower/higher ranges for alarms and glucose thresholds in settings.
ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of all popups when Spike is in the background/foreground.
ENHANCEMENT: Users on mmol/L can now insert commas (,) in the calibration popup.
ENHANCEMENT: Updated Apple Watch instructions with all known compatible watch faces. (Thank you Daniel Fernandez Garcia, Kamil Armacki & Phil Taylor)
FEATURE: Press and hold the PieChart for 1 second to activate/deactivate the "No Lock" feature. (Requested by Johan Degraeve)
FEATURE: New "App Inactive" alert. Turned on by default for all users. Can be disabled in Settings -> Alarms. If Spike is inactive for more than 10 minutes it will fire an alert, even if Spike is closed or crashed. This can happen if iOS closed Spike in a cleaning process or the system ran low on memory, Bluetooth antenna is not being able to receive glucose readings from transmitters, etc. This should keep everyone safer, especially during the night.
FIX: If an alarm fires and the user opens Spike within 30 seconds, not via notification but by clicking the app icon, unlocking the phone or from the app switcher, the Snooze Alarm Popup will now show. Users can still snooze their alarms from the lock screen notification if they choose so. (Johan Degraeve)
FIX: Calibration request popup should now appear even if the screen is locked or Spike is in the background. Just bring Spike to the foreground and the popup will be there waiting for you.
FIX: While an alarm is repeating, if the user deletes the alarm from the settings screen, the alarm now stops firing.
FIX: Other overall fixes and code optimisations.
NOTE: Nightscout follower mode is ready but requires more testing. It was supposed to be available in this update but it has been postponed for the next. It will be out soon!

I wish everyone a good week ahead!

1.0.8
FIX: Calibration alarm now correctly saves the time interval when in mmol/L. 
FIX: Crash Report & Disclaimer screens had a small bug when opening.
FIX: A rare code exception on the chart that prevented the chart from showing.
FIX: Chart being in the future AKA DeLorean Syndrome :)
TWEAK: Popups are now only rendered when Spike comes to the foreground. If popups need to be shown while Spike is in the background, they are now saved in a queue and displayed when the user opens Spike. Spike can't write pixels to the GPU while in the background otherwise it crashes (Starling framework limitation). This might fix freezes that some remaining users are still experiencing.
TWEAK: Enhancements in internal tracing and G4 instructions strings.
TWEAK: Better on screen tutorial messages for different transmitter types.

Special thanks to Johan Degraeve for helping me debug and also for contributing to some of these fixes as well! 2 are better than 1!

1.0.7
FIX: Advanced Settings are now correctly saved in database after restarting Spike. After upgrading to this version, please set your advanced settings again.
FIX: Upgraded the BlueTooth library to the latest version. Seems to be more stable for people on iOS 11.
FIX: Added some safe guards to the Loop Offline code. If Spike receives a badly formed request, it should not crash.
FIX: Several other small tweaks to try and mitigate a crash that some users are experiencing.
FIX: Chart should not display readings before the initial 2 calibrations. Needs further testing.
FEATURE: Glucose readings management: You can now see your last 24h of readings in a list and delete bad readings. This feature is accessible through the upper right menu of the chart screen, under "Readings". Use with caution! 
FEATURE: Added an exception manager. If Spike crashes, when you restart it it should now show a popup asking you if you want to send the crash log to the developer team. This will help us further debug Spike.
FEATURE: Added menu section "Help" that allows the user to trigger a visual guide/tutorial on how to setup a transmitter and start a sensor.
FEATURE: If Spike is in the background for more than 5 minutes, when the user returns to Spike it will automatically show the chart screen.
TWEAK: Removed third party library that manages low memory events. I'm not sure if this is library can cause crashes and is not really needed.

1.0.6
FIX: Stability improvements for BluCon users.
FIX: Several fixes and stability improvements for the selected few users that were experiencing missed readings (gaps). Hopefully this time around Spike is more stable for you.
FIX: App badge now displays glucose value even when the user is LOW or HIGH.
FIX: More layout fixes for iPhone X. Nightscout view also displays correctly now. Will adjust the layout of the chart screen in the next update. Thank you to Nate Travers for helping me test this in his iPhone X. You rock!
FEATURE: New advanced settings screen. All advanced users should check it out, especially those that were experiencing missed readings. Go to Settings -> Advanced.
FEATURE: Main chart can now be dynamic or fixed size. Configure settings in Settings -> Chart -> Scale.
More to come, soon...

Wishing everyone a great week ahead! 

1.0.5
Minor changes to the watch settings screen to try to mitigate a bug that happens sporadically and doesn't allow users to select a calendar. Might still need more fixes.
Fixed iPhone X black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Thank you to Josh Flynt for helping me test this in his iPhone X.
Improvements in the Loop Offline feature to make it more reliable.
Major fix for Transmiter PL users. It should work now. Thank you to Marek Macner for helping me test it!
Made some overall improvements in bluetooth connections.
Fix when editing a glucose alarm, it always showed 33.3 for mmol/L users. Also fix for missed readings alarm for mmol/L users, the time interval value was being incorrectly calculated. 
Several overall small fixes and improvements.

1.0.4
Added more debug messages to Nightscout and Dexcom connectors to provide better support in case someone has problems with any of these services.
The Today Widget was not coloring the main glucose label correctly while in mmol/L and the chart was not displaying values as it should (also while in mmol/L). Both issues have been fixed.
Removed support for dynamic coloring of the line in the Today Widget (to reflect high, in range and low values) while in mmol/L. It doesn't work well because the coloring ranges in the line need to be whole numbers, doesn't work with decimals. So, for mmol/L, the line is now always a solid color. To make up for mmol/L users, they now have a setting inside Spike to customize the line color. Mg/dL users continue to have a dynamic line that changes color if the glucose values are high, in range or low.
Fixed a bug that prevent alarms from being properly snoozed.
Added an option for "Entire Day" when creating/editing alarms.

1.0.2
Fixed a bug in the Apple Watch settings screen.
Improved layout of "Add Alarm" popup on larger screens.
Improved Offline Loop feature.

1.0.1
Initial Beta Release
